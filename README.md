## Usage

The package should work after installation. The only thing you might need to
set is the path to the `blodwen` executable in the config of this package.
If it doesn't work it's probably a bug.

There is a tutorial on how to use the editor under [`documentation/tutorial.md`](https://github.com/blodwen-hackers/atom-language-blodwen/blob/master/documentation/tutorial.md).

### Working with ipkg files

Place your ipkg file in the top level directory of your project.
There is more information available in a in a [separate documentation](https://github.com/blodwen-hackers/atom-language-blodwen/blob/master/documentation/ipkg.md).

## Todo

 - Add better support for drawing attention to error-messages
 - Improve the syntax-highlighting (the current is based on the Sublime plugin)
 - Add autocompletion
 - ...
